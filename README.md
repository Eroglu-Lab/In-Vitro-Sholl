# Sholl_Macro

A macro for analyzing fluroescence microscopy images to determine the complexity of cultured astrocytes. 

Note: ImageJ/FIJI has stopped coming with Sholl Analysis installed and the new version that can be installed through the Neuroanatomy update site is not compatible with this macro. A workaround is to install the older version of the Sholl Analysis plugin using the jar file in this repo.
